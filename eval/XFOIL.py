# Started   : 02/17/20 - Transferred from MATLAB to Python
#                      - Works as expected
#
# PUROSE
# - Create or load airfoil based on flagAirfoil
# - Save and read airfoil coordinates
# - Save and read airfoil pressure coefficient
# - Save and read airfoil lift, drag, and moment coefficients
#
# INPUTS
# - NACA         : Four-digit NACA airfoil designation
# - PPAR         : Paneling variables used in XFOIL PPAR menu
# - AoA          : Angle of attack [deg]
# - flagAirfoil  : Flag for loading/creating airfoil
# 
# OUTPUTS
# - xFoilResults : Array containing all results
