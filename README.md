# Deep Meta Reinforcement Learning for Cross-Domain Aerodynamic Shape Optimization
This repository contains all code used for my undergraduate thesis, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQGCqw7G3B_1PqtpEcPGsDrG6DE1X-SL/view?usp=sharing).

The original purpose of this research is to challenge the generalization capability of deep
neural networks by attempting a novel application of meta-learning on deep reinforcement learning
policies used to perform aerodynamic shape optimization across both supersonic and subsonic optimization tasks.
